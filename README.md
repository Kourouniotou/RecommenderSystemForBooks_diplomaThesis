# RecommenderSystemForBooks_diplomaThesis
This project investigates the creation of a non-personalized book recommendation system,
utilizing the book description text for differentiation. 
In particular, the development of this system is implemented using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, 
in order to discover thematic units hidden within the description texts. 
After the appropriate coordination of the model parameters and its evaluation with various methods, the model is trained on the
texts of the database with the books, producing the final thematic units. Based on these thematic units, each book obtains a distribution in terms of them, 
which is used in combination with the Jensen-Shannon distance in order to derive the correlation between the books and
the final recommendation. Finally, this whole process is organized in an easy-to-use application for the user, giving
him the possibility to make various kinds of searches in order to recommend books based on
his wishes.
